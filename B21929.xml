            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by Our Proclamation of the 29. of March now last past, We invited Our loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Counties of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Berks,</hi> and other Counties adjacent, who are owners of Corne and Graine, and other Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, in a greater proportion then is necessary for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:196692:4"/> their owne private Families, that for their owne benefit to secure the same against the sudden incursion and violence of the Rebels, and for the better furnishing of Our Garrison at <hi>Oxford,</hi> against a time of need, they should speedily bring the same into this City, and there store it up in such places as themselves should provide, or as We in Our care by Our Commissioners, to whom they are to resort, have there provided for them, where the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof by themselves, or such as they should nominate and trust should keepe the same, and from thence as the true owners thereof should issue the same, to furnish the Markets from time to time for their best advantage. Since which time Wee finde that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of these places not being so sensible of their owne good as We expected they would have beene, have beene very negligent in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themselves to Our desires, but doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselves, and that part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states to that danger which may fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, Wee know not how soone; Wee therefore, by the advice of the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Members of the two Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now assembled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> doe admonish
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:196692:4"/> all Our loving Subjects whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, That within five dayes now next ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the furthest, for such as live within se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles from this Towne, and for such as dwell further off within eight dayes after the date hereof, they bring or cause to be brought into this City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> all such Corne of all sorts, ready threshed, or in the Straw, and all such other Victuals, serving for the food of Men or Horse, which they can spare, here to be stored up by themselves, or sold at, and for reasonable prices, for ready Money. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that they bring in hither all such Hay and Straw as they have, and may spare here to bee sold to Us, and to the Nobility and Gentry here residing for ready Money at reasonable prices. And We, by the advice aforesaid, doe further let them know, and doe hereby declare, That if they faile herein, upon what pretence soever, We shall esteeme them as persons dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to Us and to Our Service, and as the course of Warre and the necessity thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, upon the approach of the Rebels, who are Enemies to Us and them, Wee must and will by Our owne Souldiers fetch so much thereof away, as We can, for the provision of
